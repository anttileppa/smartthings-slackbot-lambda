# SmartThings Slackbot Lambda

AWS Lambda for Slackbot that commands devices via SmartThings.

## About 

This is a AWS lambda that provides functionality for Slackbot that allows users to discuss with their Samsung SmartThings based smart home.

Currently the bot knows how to check status of their smart lights (whether lights are on or off in their home) and switch all lights off remotely. More functionlity will be available on the future. 

The project also includes basic natural language processing capabilities (NLP) so the discussion with the bot can be done with natural language instead of commands.
